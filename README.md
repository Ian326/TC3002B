A repo for the 'Development of advanced computer science applications' course
## How to use
Execute your prefered notebook under the `Code` folder. 

If you want to test in on the cloud, download the dataset required under the `content` folder and upload it directly into the Google Colab 'Runtime File Folder'

This repo is under construction. Expect weekly changes according to the requirements of my course. ;)
